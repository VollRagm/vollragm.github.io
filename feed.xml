      Introduction
Unity3D is a popular game engine used by many games, like Escape from Tarkov, Rust, Fall Guys, Among Us, and many more. The engine uses C# as scripting backend, and by default runs on top of the Mono Runtime. Since C# assemblies get compiled to MSIL, we can easily reverse engineer them using tools like dnSpy.
We are also able to easily inject our dependencies and even reference the...

      Introduction

This blog post is about how to approach reverse engineering using the Windows 7 version of Minesweeper as an example. You can get the Windows 7 Minesweeper from https://win7games.com/.

I have created a trainer and a CheatEngine cheat table as well. You can find it here.

This post is written for beginners, however, I recommend having the following already:

      Introduction
Most websites or web services have an API in the backend that delivers requested data to its frontend. This can be anything from the Google Search API to delivering a message on Discord.
Some people in the gaming community scan a game’s username database for certain available special names, like 3 letter names, to register them. I’ve been asked to write a tool to automate that. To ...

      Introduction
Some time ago I spent some time reversing Task Manager for fun and practice.
I will share my findings in this blog post. Note that most of the things in this post might not be interesting and only are here to assist beginners in getting the right mindset for reverse engineering.

At first, I took a look at the Performance tab, because it seemed like an obvious t...

      Introduction

Page Tables can be a complicated concept to understand.
This is why I created PTView. You can use this tool to visualize page tables and be able to browse them.

It allows you to inspect a Windows processes Page Tables live.
You can browse through them in a GUI and dump the physical pages they point to, as well as translate virtual to physical addresses and get the virtual address...
